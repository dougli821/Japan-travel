    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Minimalist -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page dashboard with tabbed navigation for major cities (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto) and a "Pro Tips" section. This structure was chosen over a linear itinerary to provide a flexible, user-driven planning experience. Users can explore culinary options by city and filter them by food category (Ramen, Sushi, etc.). This task-oriented design allows travelers to plan their days based on interest or location, rather than a rigid schedule. The core interaction is filtering cards, which instantly updates the view, making it easy to compare options. A summary chart highlights the most time-demanding restaurants, directly addressing the user's key concern about queuing and reinforcing the need for strategic planning. The Pro Tips section has been expanded to include essential travel logistics (transportation and weather). -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: List of cities, diverse restaurants (covering high/mid/budget range), food types, crucial timing advice, June weather, and city transport tips.
        - Goal: To inform and allow comparison of culinary options and their required time investment, alongside necessary travel logistics.
        - Viz/Presentation Method:
            - Cities/Topics: Tab-based navigation (HTML/JS) for clear segmentation.
            - Restaurants: Card grid (Tailwind CSS) for a visually appealing and scannable layout, implicitly showing range via different entries.
            - Food Types: Filter buttons (HTML/JS) for interactive content sorting.
            - Wait Times: A horizontal bar chart (Chart.js/Canvas) to visually compare the most demanding queues.
            - Travel Tips: Dedicated text cards (HTML/CSS) for easy reading and synthesis.
        - Interaction: Users click tabs to switch cities and buttons to filter food types. The card grid and chart update dynamically. This interactive model turns a flat research plan into a dynamic planning tool.
        - Justification: This structure provides all information needed for trip execution: where to eat, when to show up, how to get there, and what to wear. -->
